Controller Firmware

Google released a web tool to switch the controller from the normal wifi mode to using Bluetooth LE.

If you have issues with the controllers triggers being registered as non-analog triggers (as in; they are either on or off only), a registry fix can be found here or as a pre-made reg file here.

For conservation the latest firmware versions and a backup of the web tool can be found below.
